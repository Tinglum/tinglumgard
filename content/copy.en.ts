  // FAQ
  faq: {
    title: "Questions and answers",
    subtitle: "Common questions about ordering and delivery",
    badge: "FAQ",
    commonQuestions: "Common questions",
    q1: "What do I get in the box?",
    a1: "Fixed structure, small variations are normal. You get ribs, bacon, sausages, pork chops and cooking cuts. Everything is portioned, labeled and vacuum packed.",
    q2: "When will I receive delivery?",
    a2: "Frozen box is delivered in week 48. Fresh box can be chosen for an extra fee and is delivered at the end of week 50 or beginning of week 51.",
    q3: "Can I change my order?",
    a3: "Yes, until week 46. After the deadline the order is locked so we can plan production and packing.",
    q4: "How do I pick up or get delivery?",
    a4: "You can choose delivery along E6 between Levanger and Namsos, or Trondheim. Price is shown in checkout before you confirm.",
    q5: "What is Mangalitsa?",
    a5: "Mangalitsa is an ancient Hungarian woolly pig breed known for extraordinary meat quality. The pigs grow slowly, live outdoors, and develop a deep, nutty flavour completely unlike regular pork. We are one of very few producers in Norway.",
    q6: "What is so special about the Mangalitsa fat?",
    a6: "Mangalitsa has unique intramuscular fat with a higher proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids than regular pork, actually comparable to olive oil. This gives the meat a butter-like tenderness and a richness you won't find anywhere else. The fat melts at a lower temperature, which makes the ribs juicier, the bacon more flavourful, and the rendered fat perfect for cooking vegetables or making sauces.",
    q7: "How much freezer space do I need?",
    a7: "Plan for roughly 30 litres per 10 kg of meat. A small box (approx. 10 kg) fits in a standard freezer drawer, while a large box (approx. 25 kg) needs half a chest freezer.",
    q8: "How long does vacuum-packed meat last in the freezer?",
    a8: "Vacuum-packed and frozen, the meat keeps for 12-18 months without quality loss. Labels on each pack show contents and date, so you always have full overview.",
    q9: "How does the deposit payment work?",
    a9: "You pay 50% at the time of order as a deposit via Vipps. The remaining balance is invoiced before delivery in week 46. The deposit secures your spot and kicks off production.",
    q10: "Can I share a box with someone?",
    a10: "Absolutely! Many customers share a larger box with family or friends. Choose a bigger box and divide it yourselves, everything is already portioned and labeled, making it easy to split.",
    q11: "Do you deliver outside Trøndelag?",
    a11: "Currently we offer farm pickup, selected points along the E6 between Stjørdal and Namsos, and Trondheim city centre. We're working on expanding, but cannot promise delivery outside these areas yet.",
    q12: "What if I have allergies or special requests?",
    a12: "Our products are pure pork with no additives. Sausages and bacon contain spices and salt, a full ingredient list is included. Get in touch if you have specific needs and we'll find a solution.",
